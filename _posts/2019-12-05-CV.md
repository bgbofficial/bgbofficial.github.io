# Education

I'm currently studying for my PhD degree,  in school of computer science. 

I'm broadly interested in computer vision, machine learning and magnetic resonance imaging, a branch of AI (Areificial intelligence). My research involves visual reasoning, medical images generation, and image generation using deep neural networks.
